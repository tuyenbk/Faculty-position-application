\begin{letter} {Faculty Search Committee\\Department of XXX\\YYY University\\ZZZ Address}

\opening{Dear Faculty Search Committee,}
%---introduction
I'm writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor in Construction Engineering and Management beginning Fall 2017, as advertised on the university website.
%
Presently, I'm a Ph.D. candidate with a specialization in Construction Engineering and Management at Iowa State University under the direction of Dr. David Jeong and will graduate in May 2017.
%
%I'm excited to the opportunity to join XX School where has excellent undergraduate program and excellent faculties.
%
I believe that, my research background, considerable experience in developing awarded proposals in the area of automated manipulation of digital infrastructure data from national sponsors, and my teaching commitment and mentoring experience prepare me strongly qualified for the needs of YYY' dynamic program/ this position described in your advertisement.

%-Research experience
%-research interests

%
Research experience, dissertation for data utilization, project, huge amount of data collected in digital dataset including Building Information Models, recreated due to the fragmented nature of the construction industry, databases are isolated storage, there is a lack collaboration among project stakeholders. 
%
%This dissertation, specifically addresses the issue of data terminology inconsistency when extraction and exchange of digital models between the data receiver and sender may not have the same understanding to the same set of data.  
%
Currently, I am a lead researcher in a inter-discipline team in NSF-funded project that aims to
%
I'm also working on another project I have involved as a main researches, who collect data, analyze and writing report in two funded projects (both under supervision of Dr. Jeong) that aims to develop a guide on digital data sharing through the life cycle of transportation assets. The success of this research will allow. 
%publication
The results of these research have been published on high-impact factor journals such as Automation in Construction, and presented at several major conferences, for instance CRC2016 or ISARC2016. I also have the revision version of one manuscript on submitted to the Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering is under reviewed and am finalizing another two manuscripts on planned to for submission during this academic year. 
%
These publications allow me to learn how to effectively disseminate results from scientific research, discuss the research with colleague around the world and network to have collaboration with other researchers.

%-Proposal for fundingDuring the last 5 years, I have gained extensive experience in securing funding as a Principle Investigator and Lead Proposal Contributor from competitive sponsors from various federal to state sponsor agencies such as NSF, state highway agencies, project management institute. 
%
I led one research with the role of Principle Investigator in 2013. 
%
During my doctoral study since 2014, I have been a lead contributors for total 6 research proposals for funding. 
%
Recently, I developed a proposal on NLP based data extraction from CIM which resulted in an NSF grant (\#1635309) of almost $\300,000. 
%
I addition, i developed several proposal for industry institute like Project Management Institute. I was Principle Investigator (PI).  
%
Involvement in these funding process enable me to gain knowledge and experience in funding requirements, proposal writing experiences for a variety of types of sponsors from theoretical research to implementation research, from national funding to state levels, and academic institutes, who my have different requirements. Secure funding from competitive proposal process. get me ready to apply for highly competitive federal and state grants. %Success in the above initial publications and funding proposals in competitive funding programs enable me to continue my long research interest in enhancing project delivery through automation, future research will focus on digital data.
%
I have become familiar with development process of articulating research ideas into a research proposal (identify goals, possible outcomes, and intellectual merit of a research projects, feasibility proof/prove ability to complete proposed work through published preliminary studies, create inter-discipline team), grant application 
%
I plan to do research to enable automated extraction of digital, better management of digital data and enhance reusability of life-cycle data through construction project. Automated data collection, big data, that allow reduce effort in collecting, effort duplicate, data processing for wide range of business process involved in the project delivery.  

%-Teaching experience: (Verb: taught, instructed, advised, consulted, guided, helped, tutored, lectured)
I have teaching and supervising when I worked as lecturer and instructor in the last 5 years. As a lecturer at Ho Chi Minh City University, I developed lectures and taught and supervised students in various undergraduate courses ranging from ... .My performance in teaching resulted in my {\sl Outstanding Youth Staff Award}.
%
During my doctoral program, I have served as instructor of an Web-based graduate course Teaching experience as instructor, lecturer, guest lectures and metering. I designed lectures and delivered lectures for wide range of construction engineering and management course for instance, economics, project management, project scheduling and estimating for undergrad level. For graduate level, I have been an instructor since 2015. I was invited to provide a guest lecture to graduate student in the course CE595A where cutting edge studies are introduced to graduate students. I have opportunity for run both online classes and on-campus students. Through this classes, I have learned how to effectively communicate with distance-students through emails, phone calls and run discuss forum in this web-based learning system. I have provided direction to a undergraduate student in a funded project. Maintain regular posted office hours. 
%future course


%ClosingWith all above experience in research, independently developing funding proposals with several awarded and my commitment to research and transferring critical knowledge and cutting-edge research, technologies and applications to graduate students make me a well qualified candidate. I believe if selected, I will have significant contribution the construction engineering program to the school and successful in project funding, curriculum development. I have enclosed my Curriculum Vitae, research statement and teaching statement. I can be reach me at 515-203-5273 or ttle@iastate.edu. I will be glad/willing to supply any additional required materials. Look forward to interivews with you. Thank you for your time and consideration and look forward to hearing from you.
